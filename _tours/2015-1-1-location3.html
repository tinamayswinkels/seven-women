On our trekking tours, you will experience the beautiful Himalayas up close on our 7 day Gori Pani Trek. This will include a flight to Pokhara and stays in tea houses along the way. We employ local guides which will exceed your expectations and visits to landmarks and world heritage sites will come after the trek
