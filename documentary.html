                This film follows a group of Nepalese women over a period of four years. The womenâ€™s lives have been radically changed with access to education and skills training; providing them with the ability to be self sufficient with sustainable income generation. A story of courage, resilience and strength, these women seek to create a better life for themselves, their families and other women in Nepal.
