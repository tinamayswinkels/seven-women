    <div class="box-text editable"><p>Young Australian social entrepreneur Stephanie Woollard began Seven Women at only 22, after meeting seven disabled women operating out of a tin shed in Kathmandu struggling to make a living and enduring harsh discrimination. Since 2006, Seven Women has been working to empower marginalised Nepalese women through equipping them with the skills and know how to thrive.</p><p>Eleven years after her first encounter with the seven women that started it all, over 5,000 women have been trained and employed by our fair trade organisation, transforming their lives and their communities. Stephanie was recently one of only 6 worldwide to have her work recognised with a Rotary Responsible Business Award presented at the United Nations, New York.</p></div>

  </div>

<section>
    <p class="editable third-height">Seven Women has two core businesses: a cooking school and manufacturing business. We are partnered with Hands-On-Development, who host cultural tours in Nepal bringing visitors of varied skills to participate in our classes, hire our women as local tour guides and provide support through sales in our shop.<br /><br />Activities foster cross-cultural exchanges and opportunities for visitors to learn about social enterprise, some of the deeper issues in Nepal and gain real, authentic local experiences. We look to engage with tour companies of similar nature to bring customers to experience a range of activities led by marginalized women who have gained skills, self-confidence and incomes through Seven Women.<br /><br />At our Kathmandu headquarters we offer:<br /><br /><em>Cooking school:</em> Guests learn traditional cooking techniques whilst supporting the hospitality training of Seven Women.<br /><br /><em>Craft class: </em>Learn how to create Nepalese crafts and witness the importance of Fair Trade firsthand<br /><strong><br /><em>Literacy classes:</em> </strong>Basic Nepali for travellers taught by local Seven Women<br /><br />The profits from these activities fund our Seven Women programs in Kathmandu and village areas including:<br /><br />- Emergency accommodation<br />- Scholarship fund<br />- Savings and loans<br />- Women's training: health, women's rights, gender awareness and literacy<br />- Skills training and income generation<br />- Business training</p>

    <h2 class="editable center" style="color:{{page.text-color-three}};">Our Results</h2>
  </div>

<section>
    <p class="editable third-height">Since our foundation 11 years ago, Seven Women has trained and employed over 5,000 women.<br /><br />The manufacturing arm continues to train women who are given the choice to continue to work for Seven Women, other companies, or for themselves. The more orders we receive, the more women we are able to train and employ to fulfill orders.<br /><br />Our cooking school was built to enable the diversification of the women's skills so manufacturing products was not their sole career path. The school offers opportunities to learn hospitality and culinary skills which creates employability in the restaurant and hospitality sector. Seven Women also trains teachers for our cooking classes and encourages all women to have a turn as it develops their confidence, language skills and capabilities in a team environment with foreign guests.<br /><br />Our village programs empower women in areas of agriculture, small business creation and literacy.</p>

    <h2 class="editable center" style="color:{{page.text-color-four}};">Our Development Model</h2>
  </div>

<section>
    <p class="editable third-height">Seven Women is continually expanding and seeking to make its operations in Nepal self-sustainable. Local income streams are continually developed at our headquarters, to cover a large part of our operating costs. The cooking school, fair-trade craft classes and basic Nepali lessons for travellers generate revenue. The shop at the Seven Women centre where visitors purchase and take home beautiful handmade items also raises important funds. All income from these activities funds Seven Women&rsquo;s main programs for marginalised women in both our Kathmandu centre and our work in remote villages.<br /><br />Our approach has always been &lsquo;nothing for free&rsquo; which honours the women&rsquo;s ability to learn, earn and provide for themselves and their families earning fair trade wages. &gt;<br />Meanwhile, products made by the Nepalese women are distributed by Seven Women Australia volunteers to over 120 shops around Australia and various international buyers.<br /><br />Philanthropists and businesses such as Intrepid, Cooper Investors and Wilderness Wear also provide generous sponsorship towards our work.<br />&nbsp;</p>
