  <h2 class="editable">Our Story</h2>
  <p class="editable nopad no-margin">Young Australian social entrepreneur Stephanie Woollard began Seven Women at only 22, after meeting seven disabled women operating out of a tin shed in Kathmandu struggling to make a living and enduring harsh discrimination. With her last $200, she paid for trainers to up skill the women to produce products for sale locally and abroad - and so Seven Women was born.&nbsp;<br /><br />Since 2006, Seven Women has built a team of fantastic people, that have been working to set Seven Women Australia up as a fundraising arm and sales channel for our ever growing operation in Nepal. Seven Women Nepal's focus is on empowering marginalised Nepalese women through equipping them with the skills and the know how to thrive. Eleven years after her first encounter with the seven women that started it all, over 5,000 women have been educated, trained and employed transforming their lives and their communities.</p>
