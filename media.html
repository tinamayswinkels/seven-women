      Without precise calculations we could fly right through a star or bounce
      too close to a supernova and that'd end your trip real quick, wouldn't it?
      What's that flashing? We're losing our deflector shield. Go strap yourself
      in, I'm going to make the jump to light speed.Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be
      very pleased with that one, sir.'

I'm never gonna get out of here! Is there anything I might do to help? Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on.Your friend is quite a mercenary.
